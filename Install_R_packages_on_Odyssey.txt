Installing R packages on Odyssey

# Prerequisite: Create a directory for your R package installs in your home folder on Odyssey.
$ mkdir -pv ~/apps/R

# Set environmental variable each time you're installing new R packages 
# so they get installed into the local directory you created in the previous step.
# Or add this line to ~/.bashrc:

$ export R_LIBS_USER=$HOME/apps/R:$R_LIBS_USER

# Start an R session and install packages as you normally would and they will be installed locally.
